Part 1: Choose a Topic

For this project, I came up with the following potential topics:

1. How do wait times at theme parks change over the course of a day? Using this information, when is the best time of day to go to a theme park?
2. How do the temperature and atmospheric conditions on Mars change over the seasons, and how does it compare to Earth's seasons?
3. What factors significantly influence the IMDB score, Rotten Tomatoes Score, and Box Office of movies?

I received the following feedback on these topics from my fellow students:

Kylie: "I like your first two topics a lot, I’d say whichever one you’re most interested in you should go for. I think both offer
good opportunities to visualize your findings and make interesting conclusions."

Rebekah: "I like all your topics Justin. I like your first one the best as a marketable tool even for people who like to plan ahead
and miss heavy wait times for amusement parks. I do find number 2 really interesting too, it is always cool to find out more about
Mars and especially compare it to what we know here on earth."

Davis: "I don't mean to shake things up but I actually like the last one the most. I think both producers and regular people alike
would find the conclusions at least semi interesting."

Based on this feedback, I decided to go with my first topic idea related to theme part wait times. I was encouraged by the fact that
my fellow students thought this topic would be appropriate for analysis. I also liked the idea that this topic could be marketable for
people who like to plan ahead for their theme park trips.
