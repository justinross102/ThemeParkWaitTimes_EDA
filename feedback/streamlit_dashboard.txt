Here is the feedback I recieved for my Streamlit dashboard:

Tyler Smith:
- Overall, the dashboard looks amazing! You have descriptive sentences that explain what the user will be seeing which makes
  it easy for the user to interpret the data.
- This is nitpicky, but maybe consider making ‘attraction’ on your tooltip and y-axis plural since the amusement parks will have
  more than one attraction (hopefully). (Number of Attractions per Park plot).
- I loved the ability to view more than one park at a time!
- Is your streamlit work located in a different repository than everything you used for the blog post? You may want to consider including
  a Github link where your streamit code is located as well!

Nate Lewis:
"Justin, I think your dashboard looks really good. 

For the Theme Park Lands section  I noticed a handful of them aren’t desperate into lands but instead seem to be more like type of attraction
or target audience. Maybe note that in the description unless you think that makes it too wordy. 

Also it looks like Discovery Kingdom was only open Saturday evening on the days you were looking at which makes it a bit awkward high/low wait
times and closures sections. You probably have already noticed but I thought I’d just bring that to your attention in case you hadn’t."

Rebekah Webb:
- The streamlit app looks really good and is well organized, and fun to interact with. I thought it was cool that you had both the box plot and
  violin plot options to play around with to see the different results in wait times for the theme parks.

Autumn Brown (my wife):
- On the highest and lowest wait times, is it possible to label afternoon on your slider? It is a little misleading because I didn’t realize
  afternoon was an option
- The top 5 labels go 0-4 which may be confusing to non techy people
- Other than that, I love it!
