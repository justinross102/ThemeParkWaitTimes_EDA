The SHA number of the commit with the first draft I shared is dad35a5.

Here is the feedback I recieved:

Tyler Smith:
- This is insanely good
- Very interesting stuff
- I really like how you emphasized your research questions by bolding them. Your visualizations look great and do a good
  job of answering the questions. I don’t think you need ‘from’ and ‘during’ together and probably don’t need morning, afternoon,
  and evening capitalized in intro.
- You might not need to suggest that smaller parks have higher wait times since you debunk that later on when you talk about the
  weak correlation between those two variables in your scatterplot
- Maybe I am just dumb and don’t know how to read charts, but I was a little confused about the point plots. Are the vertical line
  representative of the the confidence intervals? It might be helpful to speak briefly about why you included the confidence intervals
  and how that can be interpreted with the wait times

Nate Lewis:
I think this post is really good. The one thing I noticed was you ask the question in bold “What attractions have the
highest wait times in each park?” but then it switches to the top five across all parks for each time period and the
question in bold is never answered. 

Rebekah Webb:
- I think it looks great, visually, the graphs that were used were colorful, and easy to follow.  I like how you used a
  violin plot in addition to a boxplot to explain the more in depth look at the response variable and how that produces
  a different result of wait times.
- This blog is organized and well formatted like your first blog.
- I liked how you listed the questions that you wanted data to answer in each of the sections on your blog in bold. It might
  stand out more if the questions are with the title of each section, and then the explanation of how the data answered the
  question follows.
